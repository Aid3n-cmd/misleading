This is an (almost) usless code but its kinda funny.
NOTE: IT IS REQUIRED THAT YOU INSTALL PYTHON ON YOUR COMPUTER FOR THIS TO WORK (download for windows included in zip)
You cannot install python on Chrome OS so it wont work on Chromebooks
but Mac OS and Windows will work.
All releases before  1.x.x will be mostly major and when the releases get to 1 is when i am satisfied with the code. 
Anything after 1 will be small changes
